# Latent Diffusion Models in Medical Imaging: An Intuitive Introduction
Daniel Jacobs - Massachussetts Institute of Technology - Dec 8th, 2022

Superficially the use of generative models in medical imaging may not seem relevant. The concern is typically around real cases with real data.
But to work generative models learn features of the underlying population space that might actually be very useful to doctors. For some intuition, in mammograms, if a generative model is capable of understanding the formulation behind the apperance of dense tissue vs that of tumor, it may be able to function as a filter, producing an imagine identical to the input but with the dense tissue removed, allowing a radiologist to see better.

First, let's understand what latent diffusion models are why they are strong:
